v0.46.55 - Friday, May 20, 2016
- further significant foundation code optimization, resulting in (probably noticeably) faster and more efficient logic and processing

v0.46.54.4 - Thursday, May 19, 2016
- v0.46.54.2-4 - "Stickiness" feature now applies when a bookmark is opened in the background while viewing a currently cloaked tab
- v0.46.54.1 - fixed issue where DP icon was showing it was enabled even when it wasn't
- v0.46.54.1 - fixed situations where the default coffee cup DP icon would be shown despite a custom icon being selected (e.g. creating a new tab)
- optimized foundation code (this is a significant update, too many to list: below are some of the major improvements)
- improved whitelist/blacklist checks
- tab cloak data now includes window IDs for guaranteed tab-specific cloaking
- toggling Global Mode in Options is now enforced immediately (e.g. favicons and page titles) (thanks Vineet)
- "Stickiness" feature (cloaking new tabs opened from cloaked pages) now checks if the new tab's domain is whitelisted or not before cloaking
- eliminated various redundant lookups (e.g. whitelist/blacklist checks)

v0.46.53.3 - Tuesday, May 10, 2016
- auto-update hotkey toggle if stored in old format, fixing issue where the toggle doesn't work after recent updates
- fixed potential issue where DP icon won't appear in the address bar
- now the "Safely open in new tab" context menu item doesn't override your Cloaking Level (previously it was resetting it to SFW0)
- added checks so DP won't try to cloak internal Chrome pages (improving efficiency since extensions don't have permissions to modify them)
- made Update page open in a background tab instead of the foreground (if "Show Update Popup" is enabled in the Options page)

v0.46.53.2 - Thursday, May 5, 2016
- v0.46.53.2 = tweaked Paranoid Mode to Cloak behaviour, fixed page favicon and page titles toggling, and hotkey changes now take effect immediately
- updated core DP cloaking functions so that DP Option setting changes and the Paranoid Hotkey toggle take effect immediately (without temporarily uncloaking and recloaking open tabs)
- optimized number of calls when cloaking a page (from 3 to 1)
- tweaked page favicon cloaking to be instant
- all DP cloaking identifiers now unique on every page load to avoid conflicts/being overwritten
- more reliable "tab stickiness" (if enabled)

v0.46.52.2 - Wednesday, May 4, 2016
- added new Paranoid Hotkey toggle (default: ALT+P) which toggles between Paranoid mode (all images/media hidden) and the Cloaking Level you chose. Like the cloaking toggle, you have full control over what the hotkeys are (the .1 in the version number v0.46.52.1 = a fix so that any change to the Paranoid Hotkey combo is actually saved; .2 = tweaked Paranoid behaviour)
- toolbar icon action now respects DP enabled state
- tweaked hotkey visual display and fixed potential issue

v0.46.51 - Thursday, April 28, 2016
- fixed issue where "Show Images Within" setting not taking effect (thanks Vineet)
- fixed issue when using Global Mode and whitelisted sites with a www. prefix (thanks Robert)
- when whitelisting/blacklisting a domain from the toolbar icon, the changes are now reflected immediately. If removing from lists, it will respect your specified settings and cloak the tab accordingly (e.g. if Global mode or cloak new tabs by default) (thanks Robert)

v0.46.50 - Tuesday, April 26, 2016
- cloaking hotkey toggle now plays more nicely with Mac devices (thank you Vineet for testing)
- more thorough font/link cloaking (e.g. Amazon product pages) (thank you Vineet for reporting)
- added new option: "Remove whitespace taken up by hidden element(s)" (e.g. if you use any mode other than "Paranoid" and set the unhovered opacity to 0, this gives you the ability to remove the whitespace) (thank you Vineet for suggesting)
- added the ability to right-click the DP icon in the toolbar and quickly whitelist/blacklist the current tab, or remove it from either list (thank you Robert for suggesting)
- improved Twitter compatibility (videos now visible)
- tweaked Paranoid mode to remove whitespace taken up by hidden elements
- DP is now on Github so you can view exactly what code changed from update to update: https://github.com/andryou/Decreased-Productivity
--- Over this summer I hope to start looking into creating a version of DP for Firefox!

v0.46.46 - Friday, February 12, 2016
- I'm proud to present a shiny, (kind of) new, and more organized Options page! Yay!
-- Settings have been grouped under three tabs: 1) General; 2) Cloak; and 3) Lists
-- The demo area has been improved to reflect your setting changes in real-time (found under the "Cloak" tab)
- added the ability to set your own custom font (if left blank, it will default to Arial)
- improved compatibility with Twitter ("view profile" page)
- better handling of cloaking manually triggered iframes (e.g. the "View Activity" button in Twitter)
- now handles images loaded after the initial page load (e.g. "Load More" type pages); relevant if you have set DP to show images that are within a certain resolution
- added more names to my list of generous coffee-buyers :) (much appreciated, thank you all!)

v0.46.45 - Tuesday, February 9, 2016
- New default cloak level: SFW0 => cloak images AND videos, instead of hiding videos.
--- This new default behaviour will give you a better browsing experience due to the increase of .webm and .gifv images on websites (most of which use the <video> element and were getting hidden).
--- If you prefer the previous behaviour (cloak image and hide videos), you can choose SFW1 on the Options page.
--- I've personally updated all 17 locales to reflect this new option.
- SVG elements now cloaked as well (video player controls visibility (e.g. YouTube) should now be improved)

v0.46.44 - Friday, February 5, 2016

- cloaking now also applies to element shadows, filters (e.g. inverting colours), and :before/:after styling
- better handling of cloaking iframes
- fixed minor bug where it would insert the cloaking CSS multiple times into the same page (impacting uncloaking on image hover)
- improved compatibility with Facebook (images now hover friendly), Twitter (quoted tweets), Instagram, and Reddit (if using the Reddit Enhancement Suite extension), yay!
- updated jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Hotkeys to latest versions
- cleaned up the code => possible increased performance (due to less redundancy)
- added Italian locale (thanks Lorenzo!)

-updated behaviour to be more logical; now DP won't be automatically enabled on all sites once a blacklisted site is visited while in global mode
-updated options page to be more intuitive (glorious lines! (aka borders))
-changed default font to Arial from Calibri (reasoning: Arial is older than Calibri and more likely to be on more systems). If Arial doesn't exist on the system, a sans-serif font will be used.

-added names of more generous donors to Options page :)

v0.43-v0.44 - Saturday, October 23, 2010

-to update your Chrome, click on the Wrench => About

v0.37
-overall code clean-up and optimization for faster styling of pages

v0.36 - Sunday, October 17, 2010
-added option to "Show Context Menu"
